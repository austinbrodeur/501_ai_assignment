# 501_ai_assignment

## Part 1 Report

* Added more dense layers, as one layer is not optimal.
* Changed number of units in top two layers to 128.
* Changed layer activation types (relu for input layers, softmax for output).
* Changed model optimizer to Adam, as it seems to perform much better than sigamoid.
